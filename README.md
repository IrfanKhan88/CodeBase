# CodeBase
Initial Codebase commit

This project aims at parsing a given txt file.
And saving the parameters parsed from the file to a particular website via a httppost request.
We get a 200 response code on successful save.
Next the whole operation should be network fault tolerant.
i.e if the network gets disconnected and is again connected then the app should automatically start saving from the point it left.
